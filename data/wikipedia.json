Wagner Group rebellion Wagner Group plane crash Operation Synytsia On 15 November 2022, a missile struck the territory of Poland at the village of Przewod\u00f3w near the border with Ukraine, killing two people.[1][2][3] The incident occurred during an attack on Ukrainian cities and energy facilities by Russia.[4][5] It was the first incident of a missile (vis-a-vis prior UAV incursions) fired from Ukrainian army[6] landing and exploding within NATO territory during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[7][8] Initially Ukraine accused Russia of striking Poland,[9] while United States claimed that the missile was likely to have been an air defence missile fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.[10][11][12] This was later confirmed in September 2023 by the Polish Prosecutor's Office, which stated that the explosion was caused by an out of control air-defence missile S-300.[6][13]\n Poland Przewod\u00f3w the border with Ukraine [1] [2] [3] attack Ukrainian cities [4] [5] prior UAV incursions [6] NATO Russian invasion of Ukraine [7] [8] [9] air defence Ukrainian [10] [11] [12] [6] [13] Background 2022\u20132023 Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure \u00a7\u00a0November The explosion happened on a day when the Russian military extensively bombarded infrastructure all over Ukraine, the largest-scale attack so far.[14] According to the Ukrainian Air Force Command, the Russian military launched 96 pieces of various types of weapons at Ukraine on 15 November.[14] These included air and sea cruise missiles (Kh-555 and Kh-101, and Kalibr), Kh-59 guided missiles, Geran-1 and -2 attack drones, and Orlan-10 and Orion UAVs.[14] According to Forbes, one Kalibr alone costs $6.5\u00a0million, and the Kh-101 missile costs $13\u00a0million.[14] The Economic Pravda or Epravda (Ukrainian: \u0415\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430) calculated that Russia had spent between half a billion and a billion U.S. dollars worth of weaponry in the 15 November 2022 attack on Ukraine.[14]\n [14] [14] Kh-555 and Kh-101 Kalibr Kh-59 Geran-1 -2 Orlan-10 Orion [14] Forbes [14] Ukrainian [14] Explosion Polish media reported that two people (Bogus\u0142aw Wos and Bogdan Ciupek)[15][16][17][18] were killed in an explosion[19][20] at a grain dryer.[5] Polish officials stated that the cause of the explosion was unknown. Polish radio station Radio ZET reported that two[3] stray rockets fell on the village, causing the explosion, although later reports indicated that there was only one missile.[4][21] NATO members started to review the evidence soon after the explosion was reported.[22][23]\n [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [5] Radio ZET [3] [4] [21] NATO members [22] [23] Investigation After the meeting of the National Security Bureau on 15 November, the government spokesman said: \"The services will work all night to sort things out\".[24]\n National Security Bureau [24] Conflicting reports emerged regarding the origin and nature of the explosion(s) shortly after the incident. Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the projectile was \"Russian-produced\".[25] Andr\u00e9s Gannon, a security expert at the think tank Council on Foreign Relations, speculated that the missiles could be from S-300 systems.[26] S-300s were used by both combatants during the invasion both as surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, primarily by Ukraine and Russia respectively.[27][28][29] Mariusz Gierszewski, a Polish reporter for Radio ZET, reported sources claiming the missile was the remains of a downed rocket.[30] U.S. president Joe Biden, speaking from the G20 summit in Bali, said that it was \"unlikely\" that the missile was fired from Russia.[31]\n Ministry of Foreign Affairs [25] Council on Foreign Relations S-300 systems [26] surface-to-air surface-to-surface missiles [27] [28] [29] Radio ZET [30] Joe Biden G20 summit Bali [31] According to US intelligence officials, initial assessments suggest that the missile was probably launched by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.[11][12]\n [11] [12] On 17 November, Head of the Polish International Policy Bureau Jakub Kumoch gave a similar explanation that an air defence missile failed to shoot down the Russian target it sought to intercept; then \"[t]he self-destruct system did not work, and this missile led to a tragedy.\"[32]\n Head of the Polish International Policy Bureau Jakub Kumoch [32] Also on 17 November, Polish officials stated that Ukrainian investigators were likely to be granted access to the site of the explosion.[33]\n [33] On 21 November, it was reported that Ukraine will not be granted access to the investigation by the Polish prosecutor's office.[34]\n [34] On 26 September 2023, Rzeczpospolita reported that Ukrainian state did not cooperate in the investigation and did not provide any useful material to Poland. Polish Prosecutor's Office stated that the air-defence missile S-300 5-W-55, fired by the Ukrainian army, went out of control and hit Polish territory.[6]\n Rzeczpospolita [6] Reactions 2022 Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure \u00a7\u00a0Reactions Poland After the explosion, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki called an urgent meeting of a committee for national security and defence affairs.[35][36] A government spokesperson said that Poland was raising the alert level of some of its military units after the conclusion of the meeting. He also stated that Polish President Andrzej Duda spoke to Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg regarding the possibility of activating Article 4 of the NATO charter.[37]\n Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki [35] [36] Andrzej Duda Jens Stoltenberg Article 4 of the NATO charter [37] Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau reportedly summoned the Russian ambassador and demanded \"immediate detailed explanations\".[38]\n Zbigniew Rau [38] Polish president Andrzej Duda stated late on 15 November local time that there was no evidence of who fired the missile.[39]\n Andrzej Duda local time [39] International Russia The Russian defence ministry denied reports that Russian missiles had hit Poland, labeling it as \"deliberate provocation aimed at escalating the situation\".[40]\n Russian defence ministry [40] The next day, it said that Russian strikes on Ukraine had been at least 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) away from the border with Poland, and that photos of the site published in Poland had been \"identified by Russian defence industry specialists as elements of an anti-aircraft guided missile of the S-300 air defence system of the Ukrainian air force\".[41][42] Later that day, the Russian foreign ministry summoned the Polish ambassador.[43]\n [41] [42] Russian foreign ministry [43] Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy blamed Russia for the incident in his nightly video address that day, saying that \"Russian missiles hit Poland\" and describing it as an infringement upon \"collective security\" and as a \"significant escalation\".[9] Around the same time, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba labeled the suggestion of the missile being fired by Ukrainian air defense as a \"conspiracy theory\" promoted by Russia.[44][45]\n Volodymyr Zelenskyy [9] Dmytro Kuleba [44] [45] The next day, Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak had tweeted that European countries should \"close the sky\" over Ukraine after the blast.[46] Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, claimed that Ukraine had evidence of a \"Russian trace\" in the explosion, without giving any details.[47] Zelenskyy also said that he had \"no doubt that it was not our missile\" and that Ukraine should be given access to the site of the explosion.[48]\n Mykhailo Podolyak Ukraine [46] Oleksiy Danilov National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine [47] [48] On 17 November, Zelenskyy said: \"I don\u2019t know what happened. We don\u2019t know for sure. The world does not know. But I am sure that there was a Russian missile, I am sure that we fired from air defense systems\".[32]\n [32] NATO officials and member countries Due to this incident, compounded with the closure of the Druzhba pipeline, the Hungarian government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n also called an emergency meeting with its Defence Council on the same night,[49] and Defense Minister Krist\u00f3f Szalay-Bobrovniczky had a telephone conversation with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.[50]\n Druzhba pipeline Hungarian government Viktor Orb\u00e1n [49] Krist\u00f3f Szalay-Bobrovniczky NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg [50] Shortly after the alleged strike, the United States Department of Defense acknowledged reports that two Russian missiles struck a location inside Poland near its Ukrainian border, though it could not confirm them.[51] Bob Menendez, Senate Foreign Relations Chair, expressed the hope that Russia would \"apologize quickly for the loss of life and express that it wasn\u2019t intentional\", and warned of \"all sorts of consequences\", including the possibility of invoking Article 5, if the strike was intentional.[52]\n United States Department of Defense [51] Bob Menendez Article 5 [52] Poland requested a NATO meeting on Wednesday, 16 November, on the basis of Article 4. NATO diplomats said that the alliance would act cautiously and needed time to verify exactly how the incident happened.[53]\n Poland NATO Article 4 [53] Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu responded to the reports by tweeting that Estonia was ready to defend \"every inch\" of NATO territory.[54] Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo responded to the reports by saying \"We stand with Poland.\"[55] Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala tweeted that if the strikes were confirmed to be an intentional act, \"it would \"be a further escalation by Russia.\"[56] Romanian President Klaus Iohannis tweeted that Romania stands \"in full solidarity with our friend and ally Poland\" and that \"we are in contact with our partners and allies\".[57]\n Urmas Reinsalu [54] Alexander De Croo [55] Petr Fiala [56] Klaus Iohannis [57] Stoltenberg stated that Russia bears the blame, although the missile was most likely a Ukrainian air defense system or missile. After all \"this would not have happened if Russia did not fire these missiles,\"[failed verification] he stated.[58][59][60]\n failed verification [58] [59] [60] Others President European Council Charles Michel [61] Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration Moldova Nicu Popescu Zbigniew Rau [62] Naslavcea [63] Related incidents On 5 December, as Russia launched another wave of targeted missile strikes against Ukraine, a missile fell within the territory of Moldova, near the city of Briceni. Russian military expert Alexei Leonkov claimed that this and the incident at Przewod\u00f3w were similar and that the missile in both cases originated from a S-300 missile system.[64] A third missile would fall into the Moldovan village of Larga on 14 January 2023[65][66] and another for the fourth time in the same village on 16 February of the same year.[67] On 25 September, a missile crashed into Chi\u021bcani, for the first time in Moldovan territory controlled by Transnistria.[68]\n Briceni [64] Larga [65] [66] [67] Chi\u021bcani Transnistria [68] In April 2023, a wreck of a Russian missile, likely a Kh-55 missile, was discovered in forests near Bydgoszcz in Poland.[69][70][71]\n Bydgoszcz [69] [70] [71] See also Poland portal 2022 Zagreb Tu-141 crash References ^ \"Explosion kills two in Poland near Ukraine border, with US claiming Russia may not be responsible\" ^ \"Wybuch w miejscowo\u015bci Przewod\u00f3w.

The second practice session took part on the same day at 17:00 local time. Leclerc was quickest, with Lando Norris and Sainz in second and third respectively. The third practice session started at 13:00 on 30 July 2022.[6] Sebastian Vettel crashed out at turn 10, causing a red flag. Once the session restarted, Nicholas Latifi went fastest, with Leclerc and Alexander Albon in second and third respectively.[7]\n UTC+02:00 [6] Carlos Sainz Jr Max Verstappen Charles Leclerc Lando Norris [6] Sebastian Vettel Nicholas Latifi Alexander Albon [7] Qualifying[edit] edit Qualifying took place at 16:00 local time (UTC+02:00) on 30 July 2022, and lasted for one hour.[6] The qualifying session was held in dry but overcast conditions throughout.\n Qualifying UTC+02:00 [6] The first part of qualifying (Q1) saw the bottom five drivers eliminated from the rest of the session. Nicholas Latifi was knocked out in Q1 and qualified 20th and last having made a mistake at the final corner on his final attempt in Q1.[8] Yuki Tsunoda, Alexander Albon, Sebastian Vettel, Pierre Gasly and Latifi were eliminated.\n Nicholas Latifi [8] Yuki Tsunoda Alexander Albon Sebastian Vettel Pierre Gasly The second part of qualifying (Q2) saw the bottom five drivers eliminated from the rest of the session. Sergio P\u00e9rez had a lap time, that was initially deleted for a track limits infringement, before being reinstated after further inspection, with the FIA deeming that he did not violate track limits.[9]  P\u00e9rez, Zhou Guanyu, Magnussen, Lance Stroll and Mick Schumacher were eliminated. P\u00e9rez blamed Magnussen for blocking his final attempt, arguing that he would have progressed had Magnussen not blocked him.[10]\n Sergio P\u00e9rez [9] Zhou Guanyu Lance Stroll Mick Schumacher [10] The third part of qualifying (Q3) was a ten-car shoot-out for pole position. After everyone's initial runs, Carlos Sainz Jr. was on provisional pole, with George Russell and Charles Leclerc in second and third. Championship leader, Max Verstappen, locked up on his lap, so he only managed to be seventh. All cars then attempted another, final, lap to challenge for pole position, although Verstappen had power unit problems,[11] which meant he was unable to set a representative lap; he qualified tenth. Russell, competing for Mercedes, took his maiden pole position of his Formula One career,[12] he had previously twice qualified second. His pole was also the first pole for Mercedes in 2022.[13][14] Ferrari drivers Sainz and Leclerc were second and third respectively, with Lando Norris in fourth and Esteban Ocon in fifth.[15] Russell's teammate, Lewis Hamilton, had a DRS issue, coting his time and resulting in him qualifying seventh,[16] eight-tenths from pole.\n Carlos Sainz Jr. George Russell Charles Leclerc Max Verstappen [11] Mercedes pole position of his Formula One career [12] 2022 [13] [14] Ferrari Lando Norris Esteban Ocon [15] Lewis Hamilton DRS [16] Post qualifying[edit] edit Following the session Verstappen, P\u00e9rez and Gasly were critical of the stewards' handling of track limit violations.[17][18] Williams were fined \u20ac1,000 after they were found to have used a set of soft tyres in Q1 on the car of Albon which the team had already electronically returned\u2014which is illegal under the sporting regulations. The stewards chose not to impose a sporting penalty after accepting that no unfair sporting advantage had been gained by using these tyres and that the rule breach was purely an administrative error.[19]\n [17] [18] \u20ac [19] Qualifying classification[edit] edit  George Russell Mercedes  Carlos Sainz Jr. Ferrari  Charles Leclerc Ferrari  Lando Norris McLaren Mercedes  Esteban Ocon Alpine Renault  Fernando Alonso Alpine Renault  Lewis Hamilton Mercedes  Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo Ferrari  Daniel Ricciardo McLaren Mercedes  Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing RBPT  Sergio P\u00e9rez Red Bull Racing RBPT  Zhou Guanyu Alfa Romeo Ferrari  Kevin Magnussen Haas Ferrari  Lance Stroll Aston Martin Aramco Mercedes  Mick Schumacher Haas Ferrari  Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri RBPT  Alexander Albon Williams Mercedes  Sebastian Vettel Aston Martin Aramco Mercedes  Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri RBPT 1  Nicholas Latifi Williams Mercedes 107% time [15] [20] ^1 Pierre Gasly parc ferm\u00e9 [21] Race[edit] edit The race started at 15:00 local time (UTC+02:00) on 31 July 2022, and lasted for 70 laps.[6] George Russell kept first place into turn one, from Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc.[22] Further back, Esteban Ocon defended from his Alpine teammate, Fernando Alonso, who later complained about Ocon's defence on the team radio.[23] Contact between Lance Stroll and Alexander Albon meant the latter had to pit to replace a damaged front wing.[24] Kevin Magnussen was forced to pit after he was shown the black and orange flag, due to damage to the right side of his front wing.[25] The virtual safety car (VSC) was called out to pick up debris caused by the collisions. Once the VSC ended, Russell immediately pulled a 2.5 second gap to Sainz. With the help of DRS, Max Verstappen made his way through the grid, overtaking his teammate, both Alpine cars and Lando Norris, before pitting and undercutting Lewis Hamilton. Russell and Sainz both had slow pit stops, which allowed Leclerc to overcut Sainz and close up to Russell, later overtaking him into turn one. Verstappen then closed the gap to Russell and Sainz, as Leclerc extended his lead at the front.\n UTC+02:00 [6] George Russell Carlos Sainz Jr. Charles Leclerc [22] Esteban Ocon Alpine Fernando Alonso [23] Lance Stroll Alexander Albon [24] Kevin Magnussen black and orange flag [25] virtual safety car DRS Max Verstappen Lando Norris Lewis Hamilton Verstappen pitted again, with Russell and Leclerc making reactionary pitstops. Verstappen undercut Russell, while Leclerc pit onto the slower hard tyres. Verstappen overtook Leclerc into turn one and proceeded to give the lead back after spinning at turn 13 on lap 41. He re-overtook Leclerc.[26] Sainz and Hamilton pitted onto the soft compound tyres, which elevated Verstappen into first. Russell overtook Leclerc, which prompted him to pit and change onto the soft tyres. Hamilton chased down Sainz and Russell, overtaking them both before the end of the race, promoting himself into second.\n undercut [26] Yuki Tsunoda spun, causing a brief yellow flag.[27] Stroll attempted to overtake Daniel Ricciardo, Ricciardo locked up and hit Stroll, causing the latter to spin.[28] Neither driver received damage and both carried on whilst Ricciardo was given a five-second time penalty for causing the collision.[29] Valtteri Bottas had a power unit issue on lap 66, leading to his retirement and the second VSC of the race.[30] As the VSC ended, the rain replaced the light drizzle that had been present throughout the race and DRS was disabled on the last lap; all drivers managed to reach the finish without changing onto wet weather tyres.\n Yuki Tsunoda [27] Daniel Ricciardo [28] [29] Valtteri Bottas [30] Verstappen won the race, Hamilton (who set the fastest lap on lap 57) and Russell finishing second and third respectively,[31][32] leading to Mercedes' second consecutive double podium. Sainz finished fourth.[33] Sergio P\u00e9rez was fifth,[34] and Leclerc sixth.[33] Norris finished seventh,[35] ahead of the Alpines of Alonso and Ocon who finished eighth and ninth respectively. Sebastian Vettel finished tenth and was the last of the points finishers.[36]\n [31] [32] [33] Sergio P\u00e9rez [34] [33] [35] Sebastian Vettel [36] Post race[edit] edit Ferrari was criticised by media for their decision to place the hard tyres onto Leclerc's car, despite the obvious pace loss shown by the Alpine drivers earlier in the race.
